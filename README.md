# framulator
Audiovisual granular tool and place for B1 ArtScience semester project

# What the heck is this?

This research project paves the firsts steps in the direction of an audiovisual Granular Synthesizer. A technique commonly performed in the electronic music world in which sound samples are taken and manipulated in its indivisible level, only to be arranged re-synthesizing musical textures. The tool presented here, called Framulator, despite being in its early stages of development can fully perform the task on clips up to 30s at 25fps. Following a short panorama on past and current successful attempts on approaching this technique, I argue that none of these examples are available to artists and researchers. Furthermore, an analysis compares the output videos with works of destructivist artist-performer Raphael Monta√±ez Ortiz and visual artists Ulf Langheinrich and Kurt Hentschlaeger, both creators of the art collective Granular Synthesis. Finally, with the aid of philosophies of time, such as the A/B-series, Eternalism, and Four Dimentionalism, the output finds its best voice.
