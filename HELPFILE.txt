This is the helpfile for the Framulator. It gives the guidelines in order to use the actual version of this tool.
Framulator is a very shitty, noob level tool that roughly does audiovisual granular synthesis. The video file (only one per time, as for v0.1)
is preloaded and later one scrambled.

This tool was made for 2020 ArtScience semester project, by Luca Tornato. I am by no means a programmer, hence the weird code and probably
non optimized algorythm.


To prepare files:

1) Split audio from video (tested .mov and .mpg too):
	ffmpeg -input.mp4 input-audio.wav  

2) Make audio mono: 
	ffmpeg -input-audio.wav -ac 1 inputMono.wav

3) Put the original video file into 'data' folder

4) Put the audio file into the same folder as the Supercollider code

5) Run the processing sketch first

6) When frames are loaded, check the info provided by the sketch:
	Num frames -> manually (sorry) put the same value into the 'totalNumberOfVideoFrames' variable in SC
	Put the correct filename in the bufferRead variable
	Evaluate s.boot, MIDICLient, b and h variables
	
7) Now everything is good to go. Play around with the patterns and evaluate the main code block!
